# Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm [virtualizeme](https://github.com/virtualizeme)

I'm passionate about technology, especially when it comes to virtualization and cloud solutions. My main areas of interest include VMware-based virtualization, as well as cloud solutions built on Apache Cloudstack. I also engage in automation using tools like Terraform, PowerCLI through the power-actions tool for PowerCLI, and basics of automation in Ansible.
